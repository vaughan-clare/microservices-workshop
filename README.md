# microservices-workshop
1. Clone this repo
2. Checkout master
3. Open dino-facts in one tab of your terminal and gate-control in another
4. Run `npm install` in both, and then `npm start`
    - You will need node version 4+ (6 is preferred) - if you don't have one of these versions running locally and need to keep node configs for client project, let me know and we can work through using nvm
5. Install Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/apps
6. Open Postman and either: 
    - import the postman file `Microservices_Workshop_API.postman_collection.json` in the repo
    - import from URL https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1619872/collection/7EACFZK

You should be able to hit all the calls in the "Local" Postman directory once both are started.
